For some reason, jinja doesn't work with these in-line comments, so here is a duplicate file
to the original "simple_hello.html" file

<!-- Simple html file for use with Flask / Jinja app -->

<!doctype html>
<title>Hello from Flask</title>
<!-- variable name inside {{ }} will be replaced by the user specified username -->
<h1>Hello {{ name }}!</h1>
